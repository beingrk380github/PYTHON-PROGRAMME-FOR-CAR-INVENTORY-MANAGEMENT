# PYTHON-PROGRAMME-FOR-CAR-INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT

You are working on a Python program to simulate a car dealership's inventory management system. The system aims to model cars and their attributes accurately.

Scenario: Car dealership's inventory management system
Task-1. You are tasked with creating a Python program to represent vehicles using a class. Each car should have attributes for maximum speed and mileage.



Task-2. Update the class with the default color for all vehicles," white".



Task-3. Additionally, you need to create methods in the Vehicle class to assign seating capacity to a vehicle.



Task-4. Create a method to display all the properties of an object of the class.

Task-5. Additionally, you need to create two objects of the Vehicle class object that should have a max speed of 200kmph and mileage of 20kmpl with five seating capacities, and another car object should have a max speed of 180kmph and mileage of 25kmpl with four seating capacities.

The End..
THANK YOU
